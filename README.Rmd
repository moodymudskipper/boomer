# boomer <img src='man/figures/logo.PNG' align="right" height="139" />

*{boomer}* lets you look at intermediate results of a call. It "explodes" the call into its parts hence the name.
It is useful for debugging and teaching operation precedence.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/boomer")
```

## Examples

```{r}
library(boomer)
boom(1 + !1 * 2)

boom(subset(head(mtcars, 2), qsec > 17))
```

You can use `boom()` with *{magrittr}* pipes, just pipe to `boom()` at the end of a pipe chain.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
mtcars %>%
  head(2) %>%
  subset(qsec > 17) %>%
  boom()
```

If a call fails, *{boomer}* will print intermediate outputs up to the occurrence of the error,
it can help with debugging: 

```{r, error = TRUE}
"tomato" %>%
  substr(1, 3) %>%
  toupper() %>%
  sqrt() %>%
  boom()
```

`boom()` features a couple of optional arguments: 

* Set `clock` to `TRUE` to see how long each step (in isolation!) took to run.

* Set the `print` argument to a function such as `str` to change what is printed (see `?boom` to see how to print differently depending on class). Useful alternatives would be `dplyr::glimpse` of `invisible` (to print nothing).
This is useful when the output is too long.

```{r}
boom(head(sapply(seq(10^6), sqrt)), clock = TRUE, print = str)
```

`boom()` also works works on loops and multi-line expression, you can also 
`rig()` a function in order to `boom()` all the calls of its body :

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# try it out on you own, a bit too verbose for a README :)
rig(ave)(warpbreaks$breaks, warpbreaks$wool)
```

## Addin

To avoid typing `boom()` all the time you can use the provided addin named *"Explode a call with `boom()`"*:
just attribute a key combination to it (I use ctrl+shift+alt+B on windows), select the
call you'd like to explode and fire away!

The default values of the `clock` and `print` arguments of `boom()` are given
by the options `"boomer.clock"` and `"boomer.print"`, so by modifying those you
will change the behavior of the addin.

## Notes

*{boomer}* prints the output of intermediate steps as they are executed, and 
thus doesn't say anything about what isn't executed, it is in contrast with
functions like `lobstr::ast()` which return the parse tree. 

This will be noticeable with some uses of non standard evaluation.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(deparse(quote(1+2+3+4)))

boom(deparse(quote(1+2+3+4)))

# standard evaluation
boom(1+2+3+4)
```

An earlier version of the package was released as *{boom}*, but a package *{Boom}*
already exists on CRAN so it was renamed. *{boom}* won't be maintained and will
be archived, possibly removed.

Thanks to @data_question for suggesting the name *{boomer}*.
